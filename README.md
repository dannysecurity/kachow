## üß† Concepts Covered

- **2D Convolutions**: Sliding-window matrix operations for computing blur and sharpen filters.
- **SIMD (AVX2)**: Vectorized integer operations using 256-bit registers for per-pixel acceleration.
- **OpenMP**: Thread-based parallelization for row-wise matrix computations.
- **Open MPI**: Process-based distributed computing model to scale across multiple cores/nodes.
- **Matrix I/O**: Custom binary format with helper routines provided in `io.o` for reading and writing matrices.
